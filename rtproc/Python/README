To run the application, simply type 'python rtproc'.

The following are required to run:

1.  PortAudio must be installed.  It can be found at 

    http://www.portaudio.com/download.html

2.  PyAudio must be installed *after* PortAudio.  It can be found at

    http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads

NOTES:

1.  This application has only been tested on Linux, but it should run on Unix,
    Windows, OS X, and basically anywhere that PortAudio and PyAudio are
    supported.

KNOWN DEFECTS:

03/26/2013 --- The 'fuzz' effect doesn't seem to be working.  I am looking
               into this currently and hope to have a resolution very
               soon.
