To build the rtproc application, the following requirements must be met:

1.  PortAudio must be installed.  It can be found at 

    http://www.portaudio.com/download.html

    The Makefile assumes that PortAudio was installed in /usr/local, so that
    the portaudio.h header file is located in /usr/local/include.  If the 
    library is installed elsewhere, simply edit the INCLUDES variable in the
    Makefile to point to the location of the portaudio.h header file.  So,
    for example, if PortAudio was installed in /home/elvis, and the 
    portaudio.h header file is thus located in /home/elvis/include, simply
    edit the INCLUDES in the Makefile to look like this:

    INCLUDES = -I. -I/home/elvis/include 

2.  ncurses must be installed.  It can be found at

    http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/

3.  GNU make must be installed.  It can be found at

    http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/

4.  The Makefile is by default set to build in Release.  This means that
    the Release subdirectory one level deeper than the Makefile is used
    for the location of the object files and application.  It also means
    that the -g compile flag is not used, so that the application cannot
    be source-level debugged in gdb.  To switch to a Debug build, simply
    edit the CONFIGURATION variable in the Makefile to be Debug rather
    than Release.
