The code in this module was created by Paolo Prandoni and Martin Vetterli
of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne.  It is free to use and
modify in any way, but there is no obligation to support or maintain the
code in any way, shape, or form.

The project is included as part of the Coursera (www.coursera.org) course
on Digital Signal Processing, produced and distributed by Paolo Prandoni 
and Martin Vetterli of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne for 
Coursera.  It's a really fun class, and everybody should take it and 
learn the fascinating details of Digital Signal Processing!
