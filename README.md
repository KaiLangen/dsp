<h3>Coursera Digital Signal Processing</h3>

There are two projects in this repository:
<ul>
  <li>
     The C++ version of rtproc, ported so that it can run on Unix/Linux/Mac as well as Windows.  I made a few
     comsetic changes as well as the necessary porting changes.
  </li>
  <li>
     A Python version of rtproc, which should run on any platform that has PortAudio availability.
  </li>
</ul>

I should note that neither of these projects has been coded so that they are perfectly error-tolerant in all cases - I 
simply wanted to get something running so that it would be possible to test the digital filter effects, which are
totally awesome!

There is no license for this code, but I consider the code to be the property of Paolo Prandoni, Martin Vetterli, and
the &Egrave;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;d&eacute;rale de Lausanne.
